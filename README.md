#Daikibo Data Analytics Project
This project simulates a real-world data analytics internship with Daikibo Industrials. It includes two key analytical investigations built using Tableau.


📁Project 1 – Telemetry Data: Machine Downtime Analysis
  Goal: Analyze machine telemetry data from 4 international factories to determine:
        - Which factory had the most machine downtime
        - Which machine types caused the most downtime

  Tools Used: Tableau, JSON data

  Key Visualizations:
        - Downtime per Factory
        - Downtime per Device Type
        - Interactive dashboard


📁Project 2 – Gender Pay Equality Analysis

  Equality Score Classification:
        - 🟢 Fair (±10)
        - 🟡 Unfair (±11 to ±20)
        - 🔴 Highly Discriminative (±21 and above)

  Tools Used: Tableau, Excel

  Key Visualizations:
        - Pay Equality by Factory
        - Pay Equality by Job Role
        - Interactive dashboard for filtering and role insights
